                        <h2>About My Work</h2>
                        <p>I'm a commercial food photographer based in Surrey. I've been doing this for 8 years, working with restaurants, food brands, and publications to create images for their marketing and editorial needs.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most of my work involves shooting in restaurant kitchens, product studios, or on location. I handle lighting, composition and development/editing, while working with your team to get the shots you need.</p>

                        <h3>The Oscar Espinoza Approach</h3>
                        <p>"I photograph chef-styled dishes on-site—no studio, no fuss."</p>
                        
                        <p>Here's how it works: I arrive at your location with professional lighting and years of experience. Your chefs prepare dishes exactly as they serve them. I capture the authentic beauty that makes mouths water and drives sales.</p>
